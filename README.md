# bag_of_words_socialmedia

This is a repository created for code analysis of a dataset scraped from social media accounts of real people. 
The dataset was found by me online and is publicly available, and the data are for about 35000 accounts, social media being Google, Facebook, Twitter, Blogger and Youtube. 
The data is mostly text data, so a chance for me to learn to work with that. 

The detailed explanation is tracked here:
